More complex peak level data: 

Square Occupancy Heatmaps: Create a heatmap of the board to see which squares your pieces occupy the most. This can reveal your positional tendencies and whether you favor certain areas of the board. You can filter this by piece type, opening, or game result.

Piece Survival Rate: Analyze how often each of your pieces survives until the end of the game. This can highlight which pieces you tend to trade or lose too easily.

"Who Captures Whom" Matrix: A table or diagram showing which of your pieces are most effective at capturing specific enemy pieces. For example, do your bishops capture more knights or rooks?


Game Dynamics & Flow: 

Game Tree Visualization: A branching diagram that shows the variations you've played from a particular opening. You could color-code the branches based on their win/loss rates.

Center of Gravity: A chart that tracks the average position of your pieces on the board throughout the game. This can show whether you tend to have a more centralized or flank-oriented strategy.

Initiative/Advantage Timeline: If you're using a chess engine for analysis, you can plot the engine's evaluation of the position over time. This can help you pinpoint the exact moments where you gained or lost the advantage

Aggregated Advantage timeline for all games in each timeline


Just Random thoughts: 

game tags so I can have labels like 'comeback' , 'funny' , 'tactical masterpiece'. (potentially auto generated by an engine)
daily summary ( used on git style calender to capture my winning days , hovering will show wins vs loss and overall will give a red or green color based on that , maybe include accuracy for the day )
