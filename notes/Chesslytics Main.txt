General Data Viz: 

In general it would be a good idea to include sort of a blurb below each pointing out things I noticed etc

Total Games Played (by time control)

Total games win ratio

All games in a table (add filtering)

Total Time Played

Github-like days played chart

Streaks (win streaks and loss streaks , draw streaks)

Top Countries played against 
Countries passport kinda shebang with a map

Ratings graph over time for each time control(Split into week , month , year , all)

Current rank

Top Openings (Grouped Bar Chart)
maybe : Radar Chart (Openings as axes , values as win rate)

Result by openings ()

Result by oponent rating

Games Won By(Checkmate , timeout etc)

Games Drawn By (repeition , stalemate)


Special Games Collection (Will Handpick these) :

- Longest Game
- Quickest Checkmate
- Most Accurate Game (>10 moves)
- Least Accurate Win
- Personal Favorite Game
- Funny Game

Harder to include (will need to build server to process all games): 

Accuracy overtime (by time control)
Accuracy by game phase (opening , middlegame , endgame)
Search for brilliant moves
Average move times (per time control over the years)
Try correlate move time and move quality
Accuracy per opening
Initiative/Advantage Timeline: If you're using a chess engine for analysis, you can plot the engine's evaluation of the position over time. This can help you pinpoint the exact moments where you gained or lost the advantage
