# Why "ElombÃ©"?

In chess, **"Elo"** is the number you carry into every game , a quiet measure of your strength, growth, and experience. But using Elo as your only metric is like reading the sheet music and thinking youâ€™ve heard the symphony. It misses the passion, the tempo, the soul of the performance.

Thatâ€™s where **ElombÃ©** comes in , she's my attempt to hear the music

She is a private chess server , built not just to analyze moves, but to help me see myself more clearly through the games I play. And yes, I said *she*. I've started naming my servers because if you think about it, they kinda deserve it

ElombÃ© is up 24/7. She hums along on a humble $8 VPS with just 1GB of RAM. She never crashes under pressure (unless I forget an indent). Honestly, she handles stress better than most people I know

The name itself came from **"Olembe"**, which I first heard in one of my favorite songs , *Legolas* by **Odumodu Blvck**, where he says:

> "_But when in Cameroon, my babies call me Big Olembe_"

I looked it up and found "ElombÃ©," which means brave one or giant. It felt right. If Iâ€™m going to build something that watches my every blunder and still doesnâ€™t flinch at the challenge of helping me grow, she deserves a name worthy of that energy
